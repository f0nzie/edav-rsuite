# Chart: Cleveland Dot Plot {#cleveland}

![](images/banners/banner_cleveland.png)

## Overview

This section covers how to make Cleveland dot plots. Cleveland dot plots are a great alternative to a simple bar chart, particularly if you have more than a few items. It doesn’t take much for a bar chart to look cluttered. In the same amount of space, many more values can be included in a dot plot, and it’s easier to read as well. R has a built-in base function, `dotchart()`, but since it’s such an easy graph to draw, doing it “from scratch” in *ggplot2* or base allows for more customization.

## tl;dr
<!-- Nice Example Joke -->
A clever joke about Swiss fertility in French-speaking provinces in 1888? Where's that HALP MEEE button???

Here we show fertility rates from the built-in `swiss` dataset:



```{r ggdot, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 5, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)


# create a theme for dot plots, which can be reused
theme_dotplot <- theme_bw(14) +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(.75)),
    	axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = rel(.75)),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size = 0.5),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
        
# move row names to a dataframe column        
df <-  swiss %>% tibble::rownames_to_column("Province")

# create the plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = Fertility, y = reorder(Province, Fertility))) +
	geom_point(color = "blue") +
	scale_x_continuous(limits = c(35, 95),
		breaks = seq(40, 90, 10)) +
	theme_dotplot +
	xlab("\nannual live births per 1,000 women aged 15-44") +
	ylab("French-speaking provinces\n") +
	ggtitle("Standardized Fertility Measure\nSwitzerland, 1888")
```

And here's the code:
```{r ref.label='ggdot', eval=FALSE}
```
